      <h2>A. Michael</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Angelo Michael but everyone calls me MICHAEL since my dad
         and older brother also have "Angelo" as their first names. I was born in
         the Philippines and spent my early years in there. I have been blessed to
         be able to migrate here in Sydney Australia, after my mission. I have a small
         family with only one daughter and two small dogs. </p>

      <p>When my daughter was a lot younger, we love travelling in the country and overseas,
         going camping, swimming and other family outings. We just love nature! We also love
         going to church, serving where we can and attending ward and stake activities.</p>

      <p>I'm currently taking BS in Applied Technology here at BYU-I, although I received
         several IT trainings from Oracle University, Microsoft and other learning providers.
         I also have two formal Australian qualifications (AQF) in IT and in Project Management.</p>

      <p>I'm employed as Systems Specialist for a Telecommunications company and have a main
         responsibility on Systems Development. I have over 15 years experience and am
         passionate in providing system analysis, design, development, deployment and
         automation in the areas of project management, finance, human resources and
         audits systems. </p>
